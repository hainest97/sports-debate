1. The project idea is to be a discussion board that will allow users to debate sports topics.
The sites design will be sports themed. Right now, a user can create an account and login with
said account. They can view their profile information and can choose to change their username if
they want to. They can also delete their account. Another feature is that a logged in user can 
create topics, and they can edit or delete their own topics. The app is not finished, users still can't 
put posts under a topic and replies to any posts. 

2. One current issue with the project is that users must go to a separate page to edit a post. Ideally,
they would be able to do this right on the page where the post is.
